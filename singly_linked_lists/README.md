Singly Linked List in C

This project demonstrates how to create and manipulate a singly linked list in the C programming language. A singly linked list is a data structure where each element (called a node) contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list.
Overview

A singly linked list is a series of connected nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence. The list begins with a head node and ends with a node whose next pointer is NULL, indicating the end of the list.
Node Structure

Each node in the list contains two parts:

    Data: The value or information stored in the node.
    Next Pointer: A pointer that points to the next node in the list.
